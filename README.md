üéÆ Scroll Fighter is an innovative, blockchain-based fighting game that lives on the Scroll network. This game uses Scroll smart contracts and Noir contracts on Aztec to ensure secure and proofably fair fights..

‚öôÔ∏è Built on Scroll, Aztec, The Graph and NextJS.

## Partner Bounties

### Ankr

This project uses Ankr RPC to deploy the game smart contracts. See the hardhat config file [here](https://github.com/arjanjohan/scroll-fighter/blob/1784b9fefb680b3d1a046fe318004f25a14a7aad/packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts#L106).

### Aztec

A contract written in Noir is used to verify the validity of the challenger's committed strategy. By providing a proof generated by Noir, the game smart contract can use the on-chain verifier to ensure the strategy is valid. The Noir verifier checks if the fighter exists and if the moves are valid.

### The Graph

A subgraph is created to query created games on the ScrollFighterV2 contract.

## Next steps

Due to the limited time, I could not complete everything I set out to do. Additional features that I plan to add are:

- Overview of current games, using The Graph to query existing games.
- Create open games (anyone can join/accept)
