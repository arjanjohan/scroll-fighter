## Partner Bounties

### Aztec

A contract written in Noir is used to verify the validity of the challenger's committed strategy. By providing a proof generated by Noir, the game smart contract can use the on-chain verifier to ensure the strategy is valid. The Noir verifier checks if the fighter exists and if the moves are valid.

### Sindri

Scroll Fighter uses Noir and Sindri to generate proofs using the Sindri API. A very smooth and developer friendly way to interact with zk-proofs.

- [Sindri configuration](https://github.com/arjanjohan/scroll-fighter/tree/33e5e043bd6b3beb35e60fb84cbf66c5dde24264/packages/noir)

### The Graph

A subgraph is created to query created games on the ScrollFighter contract. Check out the games tab to see a nice overview of games that are retrieved from the subgraph. Please check out the screenshot above to see the games overview (it's not part of the demo video, because I completed this part very last minute).

### Ankr

This project uses Ankr RPC to deploy the game smart contracts. See the hardhat config file [here](https://github.com/arjanjohan/scroll-fighter/blob/1784b9fefb680b3d1a046fe318004f25a14a7aad/packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts#L106).

## Next steps

Due to the limited time, I could not complete everything I set out to do. Additional features that I plan to add are:

- Allow challengers to start open games (anyone can join/accept)
- Complete and polish up game display animations
